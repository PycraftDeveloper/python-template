# python-template
This is a template repository for quick python repository setups!

Note: To use this with the additional workflow, you need to create a `PYPI_API_TOKEN` enviorment variable under: `Secrets and variables` > `actions` > `Repository secrets`
and give it an API key associated to your PYPI account. Then when a new release is made, the project will be shared to PYPI, using the projects README as the description.

Note: If using repository automation, setup the `setup.py` file with the appropriate package details!
